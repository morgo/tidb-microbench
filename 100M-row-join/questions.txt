1) Does a nested loop join improve performance?
i.e. EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT /*+ TIDB_INLJ(a,b) */ count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;

2) What is the output of the following:

ANALYZE TABLE a;
ANALYZE TABLE b;
SELECT AVG(LENGTH(id)) FROM a;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM a WHERE b_id IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM a WHERE b_id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT /*+ TIDB_INLJ(a,b) */ count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT /*+ TIDB_INLJ(a,b) */ count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT /*+ TIDB_INLJ(a,b) */ count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT /*+ TIDB_INLJ(a,b) */ count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT /*+ TIDB_INLJ(a,b) */ count(*) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.b_id = b.id;
